How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because i can see the different between the old working version of the app
    and the new bug version and i can compare what's different between them.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because i can look at the old file from every point of change of the file
    and do something either just compare or copy paste the code by look at the
    date of revision/modified

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros when we choosing manual commit is we don't get frustated by lot of
    commits or revision in file history, there only be commits that we set up
    and it cleared with commit messages. But the cons is we must think about 
    when to commit and when not to, and sometimes we can forget to commit after
    big chunk of revision, or we can too much commiting or we commit in a time
    that we shouldn't do so, so it makes our file history a lot and messy

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because multiple files like in web project are related each other, so when
    we do update like adding new features, it's more than one file that changing,
    so it's easy to keep track of those files that are changing in same time and
    we can compare those files to another time state

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Because git log shows us log of every commit or file verision, and git diff
    compare 2 different version of file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can easily revert to previous working version with git checkout
    and try to figure out what code break the project

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try using Git for commiting every project in study that I made
