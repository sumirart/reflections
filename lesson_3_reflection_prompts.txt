When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I want to practice to use Git and Github, when I want to publish my work so
    other people can see and edit my work, and when I need to work with other people,
    so it's very easy to collaborate. Another thing is when I want to backup my work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because we are not always want to have everything on our local same as everything
    on the remote. It all depends on how we work, and if Git is automatically stay
    up-to-date with everything on the remote, we might can't have an experiment or
    trying new things, fixing bug etc.
