What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

        It'll create new .git folder to save lot of things about git.
        Because I need to create new repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

        Working directory list all file in the current directory, staging area only
        list files that we are adding to it, before we finally commit to repository,
        and staging area is like experimental folder before we finally decided to
        publish to repository which is our final folder. It offers you to modify
        all the things before finally push it to repo

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

        After changing one logical change, i can add the file to the staging area,
        then afterwards i can compare what's in staging area and what's in repo,
        and check whether i add too much logical change for just one commit or vice
        versa
